\abstract{EvoloPy is an open source and cross-platform Python toolbox that implements a wide range of classical and recent nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms. The goal of this toolbox is to facilitate the use of metaheuristic algorithms by non-specialists coming from different domains. With a simple interface and minimal dependencies, it is easier for researchers and practitioners to utilize EvoloPy for optimizing and benchmarking their own defined problems using the most powerful metaheuristic optimizers in the literature. On the other hand, the design of this toolbox makes it very easy for the researchers in the domain to integrate their own optimizers and compare their performance to the state of art algorithms. }
